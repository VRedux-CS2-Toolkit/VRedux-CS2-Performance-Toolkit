## 🖌 Overview

VRedux CS2 Performance Toolkit is a system optimization and diagnostic assistant developed for Counter-Strike 2 players who want a smoother and more stable experience. It provides real-time monitoring, benchmark tools, and guided recommendations that help users tune their Windows systems for maximum gaming efficiency.  

The toolkit focuses on CPU and GPU balance, power management, memory usage, and frame-time stability. With a lightweight interface, it displays live metrics such as frame rate, input latency, and background resource usage to identify bottlenecks that can cause stutter or desync.  

VRedux CS2 Toolkit also offers automated cleaning routines for cache files, startup services, and network latency testing tools to improve responsiveness. All optimizations are non-invasive, ensuring system and game integrity.  

Built with stability and security in mind, the application follows Microsoft and Valve compatibility guidelines and uses only documented Windows APIs. It can serve both casual gamers and professionals looking for a clean, distraction-free way to ensure consistent gameplay.  

VRedux CS2 Toolkit is designed to work across all major Windows versions, making it one of the most practical utilities for maintaining system health and game performance over time.
